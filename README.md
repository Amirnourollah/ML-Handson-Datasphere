# ML-/ Datasphere Hands-On Worksop
Getting Started with Machine Learning using SAP HANA and Python


<br>

## Description

This repository contains the material for the on-site and virtual ML-/ Datasphere Hands-On Worksop with SAP. You will learn how the Machine Learning process develops using a Python Client for SAP HANA and how we can leverage SAP Datasphere within the process.

## Requirements

For this Workshop, you'll need to follow certain steps that are documented here:


### Material organization

The material consists of a series of exercises. Each exercise is a notebook to be executed. See below where to start with the exercises.

### Following the exercises

If you finish an exercise early, please resist the temptation to continue with the next one. Instead, explore what you've just done and see if you can find out more about the subject that was covered. That way we all stay on track together and can benefit from some reflection via the questions (and answers).


Here's an overview of the exercises but make certain that you have successfully completed all the [setup steps](01_Assets/setup-bas.md) first
