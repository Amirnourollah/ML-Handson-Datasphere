# Change your "credentials.json" file

1. Open Your Codespaces created under [Datasphere Exercise](https://github.com/Ermaconomist/ML-Handson-Datasphere/blob/main/exercises/tutorial-datasphere.md#create-new-database-user)  
2. Change to the file section on the left
3. Click on the credentials.json file
4. Change the credentials and update the hana_address, hana_user and hana_password with the details of the Database user you had created in the [Datasphere Tutorial](/exercises/tutorial-datasphere.md). As hana_address you need to enter the user's host name.

5. Saving is not required
6. Continue within the *codespace* with the jupyter notebook /workspaces/ML-Handson-Datasphere/exercises/10-Data-exploration-and-preparation.ipynb, following the main time line under [main description (README.md](../README.md)  

The Python Code in a Juypter Notebook is spread across multiple cells. Each cell can be executed individually. Any output that the cell might produce, such as text or charts, are displayed immediately below the very cell.
Go through the notebooks by executing the cells from the top of the notebooks to the bottom. The code can be executed by pressing the little play button on the left hand side, or by pressing both SHIFT+RETURN.
Within the notebook you find explanations of the code that is executed. When executing your first cell, you will be prompted on the top of the screen to select which Python kernel to use.
Select “Python Environments…” followed by “Python 3.10.8”. That is the Python kernel into which our Python packages (such as hana_ml) were installed.
