# Quickstart for GitHub Codespaces

## Introduction

In this guide, you'll create a codespace from this repository and explore some essential features available within the codespace. You'll work in the browser version of Visual Studio Code, which is initially the default editor for GitHub Codespaces and as well the basis for *SAP Business Application Studio*.

## Creating Your Codespace

1. Navigate to the `YOUR_USER/ML-Handson-Datasphere` repository.
2. Click **Code**, then click **Codespaces** and then the link under *on current branch*.
