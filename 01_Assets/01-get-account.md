# Getting Started with Your GitHub Account

With a personal account on GitHub, you can import or create repositories, collaborate with others, and connect with the GitHub community. This guide will walk you through setting up your GitHub account and getting started with GitHub's features for collaboration and community.

## Part 1: Configuring Your GitHub Account

The first steps in starting with GitHub are to create an account, choose a product that fits your needs best, verify your email, set up two-factor authentication, and view your profile.

### Types of Accounts

There are several types of accounts on GitHub. Every person who uses GitHub has their own personal account, which can be part of multiple organizations and teams. Your personal account is your identity on GitHub.com and represents you as an individual.

### 1. Creating an Account

To sign up for an account on GitHub.com, navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and follow the prompts. To keep your GitHub account secure you should use a strong and unique password. For more information, see "Creating a strong password."

### 2. Choosing Your GitHub Product

You can choose GitHub Free or GitHub Pro to get access to different features for your personal account. You can upgrade at any time if you are unsure at first which product you want. **For this course we only need the free version.** [GitHubâ€™s plans](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans).

### 3. Verifying Your Email Address

To ensure you can use all the features in your GitHub plan, verify your email address after signing up for a new account. 

### 4. Viewing Your GitHub Profile and Contribution Graph

Your GitHub profile tells people the story of your work through the repositories and gists you've pinned, the organization memberships you've chosen to publicize, the contributions you've made, and the projects you've created. For more information, see "About your profile" and "Viewing contributions on your profile."
