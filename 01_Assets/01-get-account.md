# Getting Started with Your GitHub Account

With a personal account on GitHub, you can import or create repositories, collaborate with others, and connect with the GitHub community. This guide will walk you through setting up your GitHub account and getting started with GitHub's features for collaboration and community.

## Part 1: Configuring Your GitHub Account

The first steps in starting with GitHub are to create an account, choose a product that fits your needs best, verify your email, set up two-factor authentication, and view your profile.

### Types of Accounts

There are several types of accounts on GitHub. Every person who uses GitHub has their own personal account, which can be part of multiple organizations and teams. Your personal account is your identity on GitHub.com and represents you as an individual.

### 1. Creating an Account

To sign up for an account on GitHub.com, navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up on the top right, follow the prompts. Select the free version.

### 1. Verifying Your Email Address

To ensure you can use all the features in your GitHub plan, verify your email address after signing up for a new account.
